# Optimum Portfolio Allocation of Stocks

Given some stocks, We can predict a good Portfolio which gives us a good returns for 
specific stocks that you want in your portfolio for a given amount of risk.

You might have seen people investing in multiple stock companies seeing their past trends and
still worry whether they’ll get the desired returns. It’s disheartening to see people give so much of
their time and energy to allocate their asset weights for different companies and still not get the
desired results.
We want to tackle this issue using automated optimized asset weights allocation for a portfolio by
maximizing expected return based on a given level of market risk in Python. Further we used
Monte Carlo simulation for calculating the Value at Risk (VAR) for the optimized portfolio. Hence,
users need not to worry about weights allocation & returns for their portfolio.

Please read the Report for explanation about the project.
